## Description
Eclectic Carnival is an Express.js & Mongoose API back end for a social network.

Users can create thoughts and other users can post reactions to the thoughts. Users can add other users as friends. EC utilizes asynchronous JavaScript functions and performs CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on users, thoughts, and reactions.

When a user deletes their account, all their thoughts are also deleted.

It uses Luxon to return formatted datetimes. Luxon is the chosen successor to Moment.js. See more [here](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/).

The app uses the `Mongoose`, `Express`, and `Luxon` Node.js packages.

## Installation

To start using Eclectic Carnival, first clone [the repo](https://github.com/mjamesd/eclectic-carnival) to your server. Then run `npm i` to install all the dependent packages.

Next, open `connection.js` in the `config` folder. Supply your own MongoDB hostname and database name if applicable. Alternatively, create an environment variable in your hosting platform with the key `MONGODB_URI` and the hostname and database name of your MongoDb as the value.

Lastly, you may seed the database by running the command `npm run seed`. If you are using Heroku, the seed file will automatically run when the app build is complete. To remove this behavior, edit the `package.json` file to comment out or remove the key-value pair for key `heroku-postbuild`.

## Usage

Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `index.js` file, then run `npm run start` to start the app.
